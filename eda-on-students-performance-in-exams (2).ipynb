Most of the students who are good at writing skills are even good at reading skills.  \n\n*Distance is a important factor in studying.  \n\n*In the number of teachers to student ratio is one of the main factor in this data set if there are most teachers in a particular School then supervision on that particular student increases there positively correlated. \n\n*The distance from the school to the hometown should be less that is most of the  students may not  show interest if the the school is far away from the home hence they are negatively correlated. \n\n*The next major part of students education is is the parents graduation that is we cannot judge that children of uneducated parents will not study well and even children of graduated parents will study good but most of the graduated parents children are studying good. \n\n*Both male and female are computing learning process but in some cases female are ahead.Race is not related to the learning process and people with various race are competing each other in the learning process we can even drop the column race from the data because that plays no role in our analysis.  \n\n# The features that are important in the students progress is\n      *The the supervision of teachers on a particular student \n      *The distance of the school from the hometown \n      *The hard work they do in a particular subject \n      *Attendance is one of the feature \n      *Personal care of parents towards children education are some of the major features that affect the children's improvement it         in there studies","metadata":{}}]}
